			<h4>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h4>
			<p><b>What is WCAG?</b><br><br>WCAG is a set of guidelines that provide a framework for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The guidelines cover a range of topics, including text alternatives for non-text content, keyboard accessibility, color contrast, and more.<br><br>WCAG has three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. Conformance at level A means that the website meets the minimum requirements for accessibility. Conformance at level AA means that the website meets the minimum requirements and provides additional accessibility features. Conformance at level AAA means that the website meets the minimum requirements, provides additional accessibility features, and provides an exceptional level of accessibility.<br><br><b>Why is WCAG important?</b><br><br>WCAG is important because it ensures that people with disabilities can access and use the web. People with disabilities, such as visual impairments, hearing impairments, and mobility impairments, can face significant barriers when using the web. WCAG provides a framework for web developers to create accessible content that is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.<br><br>In addition to the ethical and moral imperative of making the web accessible to everyone, there are also legal requirements for web accessibility. In many countries, including the United States, websites must comply with accessibility regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.<br><br><b>WCAG Guidelines</b><br><br>WCAG guidelines are organized into four principles: <b>Perceivable</b>, <b>Operable</b>, <b>Understandable</b>, and <b>Robust</b> (<b>POUR</b>). Each principle has guidelines that web developers should follow to create accessible content.<br><br></p>

			<h2>Perceivable</h2>
			<p>Perceivable guidelines ensure that web content is presented in a way that can be perceived by people with disabilities.<br>Examples of Perceivable guidelines include:<br><br>

			<li>Providing text alternatives for non-text content, such as images and videos.</li>
			<li>Using captions and transcripts for audio and video content.</li>
			<li>Ensuring that content can be presented in different ways without losing meaning, such as providing alternative text for images.</li>

			<h2>Operable</h2>
			<p>Operable guidelines ensure that web content is operable by people with disabilities.<br>Examples of Operable guidelines include:<br><br>

			<li>Providing keyboard accessibility, so that users can navigate the website without a mouse.</li>
			<li>Providing enough time for users to read and use content, such as ensuring that animations can be paused or stopped.</li>
			<li>Providing clear and consistent navigation.</li>

			<h2>Understandable</h2>
			<p>Understandable guidelines ensure that web content is understandable by people with disabilities.<br>Examples of Understandable guidelines include:

			<li>Using clear and simple language.</li>
			<li>Providing instructions that are easy to understand.</li>
			<li>Providing feedback to users, such as error messages.</li>

			<h2>Robust</h2>
			<p>Robust guidelines ensure that web content is compatible with assistive technologies.<br>Examples of Robust guidelines include:

			<li>Using semantic HTML.</li>
			<li>Providing labels for form controls.</li>
			<li>Ensuring that content is compatible with different browsers and devices.</li>

			<p><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>WCAG is a set of guidelines that provide a framework for creating accessible content on the web. It's important to ensure that websites are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. By following WCAG guidelines, web developers can create content that is usable by everyone and comply with legal requirements for web accessibility.</p>
